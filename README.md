# SWI-CEK Module (Experimental / Unstable)

Author: Ronald Mosidila  
Contact: rmosidila@trustsmotion.org

## Overview

The SWI-CEK module is an experimental, unstable, and standalone component of the Secure Workflows & Intelligence (SWI) ecosystem. It is designed for research, education, and internal SWI experimentation. It is not intended for production or external use outside the SWI architecture.

CEK stands for Truth · Safety · Quality, and this module provides vector monitoring, direct preference optimization (DPO) routines, and related experimental workflows.

⚠️ Unstable Structure: This module operates independently and is not connected to other SWI modules. Users should treat it as experimental code. Its behavior may be unpredictable and can change without notice.

## Key Principles

1. Operational Scope:
   - This module is designed only for use within the SWI environment.
   - Any adaptation, modification, or external deployment outside SWI requires explicit authorization from the developer.

2. Liability Disclaimer:
   - Ronald Mosidila and Trusts Motion do not assume responsibility for any damage, loss, or unintended consequences resulting from the use of this module outside the SWI ecosystem.
   - Individuals or organizations using this module outside SWI do so at their own risk.

3. Intellectual Property & Attribution:
   - All code and design patterns are the original work of Ronald Mosidila.
   - Any use without proper acknowledgment or authorization is a breach of intellectual property rights.
   - Proper acknowledgment must cite:
     Ronald Mosidila / Trusts Motion – SWI-CEK Experimental Module
   - Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution, or adaptation outside SWI may be subject to legal action.

## Features (Experimental)

- SWI vector monitoring routines for data verification and quality tracking
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) routines for testing adaptive workflows
- Experimental intelligence algorithms for research and simulation purposes

⚠️ Features are unstable and not guaranteed for production. Users should not assume full functionality outside controlled SWI environments.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RONIE8/SWI-CA-CERTIFICATE.git

# Navigate to the module
cd SWI-CA-CERTIFICATE/swi-cek

⚠️ This module should not be integrated with other modules outside SWI unless explicitly authorized.

Usage Guidelines

1. Internal Research Only: Use within SWI for experimentation, testing, and learning.


2. External Use:

Any deployment outside SWI requires written authorization from Ronald Mosidila.

3. Acknowledgment Requirement:

Any use, reference, or derivative work must clearly attribute Ronald Mosidila as the original author.




Contribution Policy

Contributions are welcome only within the SWI research context.

All modifications should reference the original author and maintain explicit experimental disclaimers.

Any public release of derivatives outside SWI must receive prior written approval.
